# Heart_Disease_pred

In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease using real patient data from the Heart Disease (Cleveland - UCI Repository) dataset.
The process involved data preprocessing (cleaning, scaling, and encoding numerical and categorical features), followed by training two models — Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier — which were evaluated using cross-validation and metrics such as Accuracy, Recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.
The final model achieved an accuracy of around 98% in correctly predicting the presence or absence of heart disease.
Additionally, Feature Importance analysis, Confusion Matrix, and ROC Curve were used to interpret and visualize the model’s performance in a medically meaningful way.
